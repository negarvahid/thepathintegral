## Introduction

In this article, we'll explore how to find the ground state energy of a quantum system using Qiskit. Let's start with a simple example.

## Basic Example

Here's a simple Python example you can run in your browser:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false

import numpy as np

# Simple quantum state representation
# Bell state: (|00⟩ + |11⟩) / √2
bell_state = np.array([1/np.sqrt(2), 0, 0, 1/np.sqrt(2)])
print("Bell State amplitudes:")
print(bell_state)
print(f"\nState probabilities: {np.abs(bell_state)**2}")
print(f"Sum of probabilities: {np.sum(np.abs(bell_state)**2)}")
```

This represents a Bell state, which is a fundamental entangled state in quantum computing.

## Qiskit Example

For the full Qiskit example, you'll need to install Qiskit locally. Here's the code:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: false

# Note: This requires Qiskit installation
# Run: pip install qiskit numpy

import numpy as np
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.quantum_info import Statevector

# Create a simple quantum circuit
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.h(0)  # Apply Hadamard gate
qc.cx(0, 1)  # Apply CNOT gate

# Get the statevector
state = Statevector.from_instruction(qc)
print("Quantum State:")
print(state)
print(f"\nState probabilities: {np.abs(state.data)**2}")
```

**To run this code:**
1. Install Qiskit: `pip install qiskit numpy`
2. Copy the code above
3. Run it in your Python environment or Jupyter notebook

## Next Steps

We can extend this to find ground state energies using variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) or other quantum algorithms.
